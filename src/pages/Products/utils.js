  performance: "For beginners, itâ€™s recommended to stay with one font until you have achieved mastery of that font. Play with the styles. Modern typefaces already come with many different styles, which means they share common distinct weights. Typefaces with a larger range of styles can help you differentiate text in special contexts, like a button or a label. If you still want/need to use more than one font, ensure the font families complement each other."
